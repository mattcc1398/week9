# week9

I deployed the dionaea honeypot. I encountered some issues trying to get Google Cloud working - I accidentally downloaded it from the wrong account, which caused some issues and confusion when I tried to log in with a different email on my terminal. After that was sorted out, I didn't encounter any other issues.
